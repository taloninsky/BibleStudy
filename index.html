			<ul>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						<span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">The scroll was written on the front and the back, like </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Eze2.9-10"><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">Ezek 2:9-10</span></a><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">, which says that there were written on it words of lamentation, mourning and woe.</span>
					</p>

				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						<span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">I wonder if it is the same scroll that was referred to in </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Da11-12"><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">Dan 11-12</span></a><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">, specifically in </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Da12.4"><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">Dan 12:4</span></a><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">, but this seems strange to me.  If it is, then the words themselves are sealed?  Perhaps this is the understanding that is sealed (considering that we have the book of Daniel).  Maybe the book that is being referred to is the same book, and we no longer have it, God has it.  This seems less likely to me, but I&rsquo;m just putting a stake in the sand.</span>

						<span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">Isaiah also had a vision that was &ldquo;sealed&rdquo; even to Isaiah himself (</span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is29.11"><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">Isaiah 29:11</span></a><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">).  More broadly, this takes place in the context of at least the full chapter (</span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is29"><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">Isaiah 29</span></a><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">).  So maybe that is the sense in which this physical copy was sealed: that it cannot be understood.  Just a quick note, it is very interesting what God says in </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is29.13"><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">Is 29:13</span></a><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">, that &ldquo;their fear of Me is a commandment taught be men,&rdquo; indicating that a true fear of the Lord is taught be the Lord (either formally or experientially, I assume).</span>

They are all members of the Godhead. They are all focal points of worship.

				<span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">Interestingly, the Lamb is both between the 4 creatures and the throne as well as among the 24 elders.  This is a bit of a challenge to draw out spatially, when you think about it.  In my head, the throne is in the center, the torches are before it, the Lamb is with the torches before the throne, the four living creatures are on four sides of the throne and the 24 elders are surrounding the 4 living creatures.  This puts Jesus on both sides of the 4 living creatures at the same time, if I have that right.  But, that also would point to the fact that Jesus is both God and man.  He is both firstborn among many brethren and one with the Father.  He is the first and the last.</span>

						<span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">the Greek word is &lsquo;esphagmenon&rsquo; which translates to &lsquo;had been slain&rsquo; (other translations slaughtered).  Related words which have the same root are &lsquo;Slaughter&rsquo;, &lsquo;massacre&rsquo;, &lsquo;Victim&rsquo;, &lsquo;sacrifice&rsquo;.  The Greek form indicates a completed action with ongoing effects.  Obviously, His sacrifice has the ongoing effect of our redemption, but I also wonder about the ongoing effects on the Lamb.  The text does say &ldquo;...standing as if it had been slain...&rdquo; so it is alive and upwardly mobile.  This is not a surprise, but I&rsquo;m exploring the literal text.  This is related to His mediating work </span><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="en-US">(</span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Heb7.23-25"><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="en-US">Heb 7:23-25</span></a><span style="font-size:11pt;" lang="en-US">)</span>.

Like when God is talking to the Samaritan woman and says that He can give her water so she&rsquo;ll never have to drink again. (</span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Jn4.10"><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">John 4:10</span></a><span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">).</span>

For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo; The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs&mdash;heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.&rdquo; </span>

						<span style="font-size:12pt;" lang="en-US">This passage above speaks to the Spirit&rsquo;s role in adopting us.  The means by which we cry out to God &ldquo;Abba!

						I&rsquo;m thinking that the 24 elders represent the church, and the 4 creatures represent a certain class of servant/minister before the Lord.  The more I get into reading about these creatures, I think that they are Cherubim.  It is interesting how they are represented in different passages.  It is also interesting that there is reason to believe that Lucifer was a Cherub, based on <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Eze28.12-17">Ezek 28:12-17</a> and <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is14.12-15">Is 14:12-15</a>.  (I have no idea how many Cherubim were created, but 4 are mentioned in many places, plus Lucifer, above, so maybe there were only 5 created?  I don&rsquo;t say this so that we will be afraid of Satan, but rather to give some perspective on what kind of creatures these are, IMHO, and to think about the depth of perception, the depth of choice, the history of emotion, that one of their number fell, and at least these 4 stand their guard and do their duty and fulfill their purpose.

								Apparently, from what I&rsquo;m reading, there are opinions on both sides of the aisle: that we will be glorified in an instant or that we will be glorified over the extent of eternity.  The event side scriptures: <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ro8.30">Rom 8:30</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Php1.6">Phil 1:6</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Php3.20-21">Phil 3:20-21</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.1Co15.51-52">1 Cor 15:51-52</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.1Jn3.2">1 John 3:2</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Col3.4">Col 3:4</a>.  The ongoing process side scriptures: <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.2Co3.18">2 Cor 3:18</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ro8.18">Rom 8:18</a>,

						Trying to dig deeper in the thought about Jesus&rsquo; blood as the ransom for us, I came upon  <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.1Co6.20">1 Cor 6:20</a>, which is is talking about sexual immorality particularly, that we were bought/redeemed with a price (Jesus&rsquo; blood), so that we should glorify Him in our bodies.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						This ransoming is a good thing to turn over in our heads.  We are free from sin, as <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.1Co7.22a">1 Cor 7:22a</a> points out (&lsquo;freedman&rsquo; meaning born a slave and has received freedom), but in that same verse, we are not without an owner, looking at <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.1Co7.22b">1 Cor 7:22b</a>, we can see that we are bondservants, or someone who is the property of another.  We are bought and paid for.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Also an echo back to <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Re1.5">Rev 1:5</a>, &ldquo;… To Him who loves and has freed us from our sins by His blood&rdquo; ~~~&gt; just thinking about what not only the destination (his ownership), but from the origin (our enslavement to sin).

It is set of, prophecies, promises, and blessings and comfort and future pleasure to be enjoyed.  It is well worth the read of the whole chapter, many encouraging things, but one thing that stuck out to me was the comparison with the bridegroom in <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is60.10">Is 60:10</a>: &ldquo;<span style="font-style:italic;">For I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall exult in my God, for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation; He has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.</span>&rdquo; ~~~&gt; this is in line with my ongoing connection between the model of marriage and the model of worship and our relationship with Christ/God.

Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with Him for a thousand years.</span>&rdquo; ~~~&gt; I don&rsquo;t understand why one resurrection is better than another one, but maybe God is saying that sharing in any resurrection is a blessing.

						It is hard to pass up listing <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Heb4.14-16">Heb 4:14-16</a> <span style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.  For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.  Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.&quot; ~~~&gt; </span>the reason that I include this here, is that I am still dumbfounded about the notion of the trinity.  It is a truth that I believe but do not understand.  Christ is our high priest, that is the the one closest to our God that communicates on behalf of the people (that is the role of a priest), but He is also the object of our worship and one with the Father.  He is in multiple positions at the same time.  I suppose it is as it must be since He is both God and Man.  That is so hard for me to keep in my mind, it almost makes me feel like I&rsquo;m thinking wrongly to consider him a man (in the sense that it is the degraded state from God-hood), but He really is a man.  The perfected man.  &ldquo;warts and all&rdquo;?  No warts, I suppose, but fully man.  I guess that means he has whiskers and an eye color and hands of a particular size and a hair color and all the rest.  It boggles my mind.

In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.&quot; </span> ~~~&gt; this ties thing together in a structural way.  We &ldquo;grow into a holy temple&rdquo;.  It is such a beautiful, living, progressing way of explaining our relationship with fellow believers with with the Lord.

						Probably a good one to end on, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Mal2.7">Mal 2:7</a>, &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;">For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.</span>&quot; ~~~&gt; This is interesting because typically, priests are thought of us representatives from the people to talk with God, intercede, bring sacrifice, etc. whereas prophets are generally in the role of &ldquo;mouthpiece&rdquo; of God.  Here, it points out that we, as we are all priests, and as such we are tasked with guarding knowledge and teaching others and as messengers of the LORD of hosts.  That is a particular way of talking about God, the &ldquo;LORD of Hosts&rdquo; which is typically a scary title.  This is the phrase describing Yahweh&rsquo;s role as the Lord of the heavenly armies, the commander of the cosmic forces and the head of the divine council, and the leader of Israel&rsquo;s army (Wildberger).  It is a warrior/general term.  I read that it is the most common term used in the O.T., but used much less commonly in the new testament.  In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the O.T.) they typically translated it as LORD Almighty.  It is definitely a powerful, judge, commander name of God.  I did another little side quest here…

			<p style="margin:0pt;">
				&quot;Worthy&rdquo; is &lsquo;Axion&rsquo; in Greek.  Having definitions: worthy, deserving, valuable, proper, in keeping with or corresponding to what is expected. These English words are made from it:
			</p><br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Axiom - which is often used in philosophical or mathematical contexts to mean &ldquo;self-evident truth&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which is thought worthy or fit&rdquo;
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Axiomatic - obviously similar to Axiom, but further considered universally accepted without needing further explanation.  As in, &lsquo;assumed to be true&rsquo;.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Axis - think of the x axis and the y-axis from when you learned to graph a line in math class.  though primarily derived from the latin word axis, meaning &ldquo;pivot&rdquo; or &ldquo;axle&rdquo;, it is also derived from the Greek &ldquo;worthy&rdquo; or &ldquo;fitting&rdquo;
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Axial - related to axis, but also having the further implications, such as in of a scientific or mechanical context to describe structures or movements related to a central axis…  such as the axial vs radial movements of a tire on a car.  It points to centrality.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<p style="margin:0pt;">
				&ldquo;is&rdquo; -  this is present tense.  It is a tensed verb in English, but even more in Greek.  In Greek it is the third-person, singular.  It connects the object (the Lamb) with its current quality or state (worthy).  It is also in the active voice, which means the object (the lamb) is actively performing the action of being or existing in this state.  In Greek, there is a quality called &ldquo;Aspect&rdquo; and this verb has the imperfect aspect, meaning the action or state is continuous or ongoing.  i.e. the Lamb continues to be worthy.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p style="margin:0pt;">
				&ldquo;who was slain&rdquo; ~~~&gt; in Greek, the words do not exist for &ldquo;who was&rdquo; so a more literal translation reads something like &ldquo;Worth is the Lamb slain&rdquo;.  Looking into more of the Greek implication, the form of the word slain  is &ldquo;to esphagmenon&rdquo; which is described as the perfect passive participle meaning &ldquo;having been slain&rdquo; or &ldquo;who was slain&rdquo;.  Perfect Tense means that action or event occured in the past, but has ongoing significant or results in the present.  Passive voice, the Lamb is the one who received the action of being slain, not the one performing the action.  i.e. it was not a suicide.  Lastly, it is a participle, so it specifies why the Lamb is considered worth --&gt; because of the perfection of the Lamb and His sacrifice, that is what makes Him worthy.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p style="margin:0pt;">
				Slain - other ways to translate this are slaughter, slay, kill, murder, though I&rsquo;m not implying anything about the willingness of the victim, we know He was willing, see

				&ldquo;to receive&rdquo; ~~~&gt;  in Greek the word is transliterated &ldquo;labein&rdquo; which means take hold of, grab, grasp, acquire, obtain possession, receive, accept as an object or benefit.  That is actually really helpful.  Think about <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Php2.6-7">Phil 2:6-7</a> which says that He &ldquo;...did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped...&rdquo;.  this is interesting… the Lamb, the Son, Christ, one with the Father, how does he receive anything?  Doesn&rsquo;t He have everything?  As i think about this… yes and no.  What are the things that He receives?
			</p><br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Power ~~~&gt; that is inherent power or ability.  He did lay down his power on the cross, so in that sense, he receives it back again, after conquering death. <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Php2.5-8">Phil 2:5-8</a>, yet he also had the ability to call upon power (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Mt26.53-54">Matt 26:53-54</a>).  <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is53.7">Is 53:7</a> speaks of him who had the ability to open his mouth but kept silent, which is a type of power put aside.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Wealth ~~~&gt; looking at the Greek, this means wealth, abundant possessions, prosperity.  I would tend to interpret this as he receives us as his possessions.  <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.2Co8.9">2 Cor 8:9</a>, not in the earthly (or only earthly) sense was he previously Wealthy.  He was the Creator of the Universe.  Master of His domain.  That is the ultimate wealth, to possess everything (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Col1.16">Col 1:16</a>).  Thinking of it like possessions, look at <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ps2.8">Ps 2:8</a> &quot;Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.&quot; <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Heb1.2">Heb 1:2</a> &ldquo;But in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.&rdquo;  <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Eph1.18-19">Eph 1:18-19</a>.  <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Php2.9-11">Phil 2:9-11</a>.  <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Re7.9-10">Rev 7:9-10</a>.

						Wisdom ~~~&gt; this one is challenging.  Did Christ receive wisdom?  Maybe we ascribe to Him wisdom?  Let&rsquo;s dig in:  we know <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.1Co1.24">1 Cor 1:24</a> &quot;Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&quot; and <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Col2.3">Col 2:3</a>  &quot;In whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.&quot;  Yet, we know that while Christ is fully God, is is also fully man, participated in the human condition.  This is so challenging to understand, but it is what scripture teaches: <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Lk2.52">Lk 2:52</a> &quot;And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.&quot;  <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Heb5.8">Heb 5:8</a> &quot;Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered.&quot;  Obedience is definitely part of wisdom.  Thinking about receiving might be related to fulfillment, in that Christ fulfilled God&rsquo;s wise plan (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Eph1.8-10">Eph 1:8-10</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.1Co1.30">1 Cor 1:30</a>).  I have to ponder that more.

						Might ~~~&gt; what is the difference between this and power?  other ways to translate this might be: capability, implying personal potential, strength, might, power.  I&rsquo;m still learning, but there appears to be a difference in the sense of it.  Maybe might is the active exertion of power vs inherent authority.  Wow.  So He had to lay both of those down.  He picks it back up though! <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Mt28.18">Matt 28:18</a> &quot;And Jesus came and said to them, &lsquo;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.&rsquo;&quot;, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Eph1.19-21">Eph 1:19-21</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Php2.9-11">Phil 2:9-11</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Col2.9-10">Col 2:9-10</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Heb1.3">Heb 1:3</a>, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Re19.15-16">Rev 19:15-16</a>.

						Honor ~~~&gt; it says that He made Himself a little lower than the angels (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Heb2.9">Heb 2:9</a>).  <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is53.4-5">Is 53:4-5</a> speaks of the level of honor that Jesus was afforded while on earth.  <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ps22.6-8">Ps 22:6-8</a> says &ldquo;But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by mankind&rdquo;.

						Glory ~~~&gt; Christ asks the Father to glorify Him (Christ) in <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Jn17.5">Jn 17:5</a>.

						Blessing ~~~&gt; what does it mean to receive blessing?  The Greek word is eulogia.  which is like eulogy.  interesting.
