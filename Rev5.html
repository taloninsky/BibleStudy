		<span style="font-size:11pt;">Coming right off the last chapter, where we saw God the father on the throne, what is the next vision all about?</span>

	<p style="margin:0pt;">
		<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Re5.1"><span style="font-size:11pt;">Rev 5:1</span></a><span style="font-size:11pt;"> </span>&ldquo;Then I saw in the right hand of Him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.&rdquo;

						It makes me think about the creatures and their eyes all over and on the inside in <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Re4.8">Rev 4:8</a>, but not sure if that connection is at all relevant.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						<span style="font-size:11pt;">Another interesting connection is in </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is30"><span style="font-size:11pt;">Is 30</span></a><span style="font-size:11pt;">, where </span><a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is30.1"><span style="font-size:11pt;">Is 30:1</span></a><span style="font-size:11pt;"> says: &ldquo;Ah, stubborn children,&rdquo; declares the </span><span style="font-variant:small-caps; font-size:11pt;">Lord</span><span style="font-size:11pt;">, &ldquo;who carry out a plan, but not mine, and who make an alliance, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin;&rdquo; I&rsquo;m thinking of the plan or alliance represented in a scroll/document...</span>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<p style="margin:0pt;">
				Others who may have seen the scroll:
			</p><br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						The scroll was written on the front and the back, like <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Eze2.9-10">Ezek 2:9-10</a>, which says that there were written on it words of lamentation, mourning and woe.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						I wonder if it is the same scroll that was referred to in <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Da11-12">Dan 11-12</a>, specifically in <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Da12.4">Dan 12:4</a>, but this seems strange to me.  If it is, then the words themselves are sealed?  Perhaps this is the understanding that is sealed (considering that we have the book of Daniel).  Maybe the book that is being referred to is the same book, and we no longer have it, God has it.  This seems less likely to me, but I&rsquo;m just putting a stake in the sand.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Isaiah also had a vision that was &ldquo;sealed&rdquo; even to Isaiah himself (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is29.11">Isaiah 29:11</a>).  More broadly, this takes place in the context of at least the full chapter (<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is29">Isaiah 29</a>).  So maybe that is the sense in which this physical copy was sealed: that it cannot be understood.  Just a quick note, it is very interesting what God says in <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is29.13">Is 29:13</a>, that &ldquo;their fear of Me is a commandment taught be men,&rdquo; indicating that a true fear of the Lord is taught be the Lord (either formally or experientially, I assume).

				Title Deed Idea
			</p><br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Jeremiah signs and seals title document, with things on the inside and the outside that in <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Je32.6-15">Jeremiah 32:6-15</a>, might be a type of prototype of this action, some have suggested that the scroll in question was a title deed for the future (since this is right before an invasion).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Along the lines of the title deed, it should be noted that land was not sold in perpetuity, but rather for the maximum lease of 50 years (Jubilee, technically 49 years, 7x7, since the 50th year was the year it was given back).  <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Le25.23-28">Lev 25:23-28</a>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Similarly, Paul talks about the creation being subjected to futility (the title currently belonging to Satan, but being subjected to Satan by God&rsquo;s curse in <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge3">Genesis 3</a>).  <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ro8.20-23">Rom 8:20-23</a>.  
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						The temptation of Jesus by Satan in <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Mt4.8-10">Matt 4:8-10</a>, Satan&rsquo;s tempts Jesus by a shortcut of not having to &ldquo;pay&rdquo; for the deed, and that he would just &ldquo;give&rdquo; it to Him, if Jesus worshiped Satan.

				Military elements

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ps110.1">Ps 110:1</a>, &ldquo;The LORD says to my Lord: &lsquo;Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet&rsquo; &rdquo; which indicates that their are military elements to be taken care of.

					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Another interesting aspect is that there is a document at all.  God&rsquo;s plan could just as well be in His mind.  It is not as though He would forget or that He would need to be accountable to anyone else about it.  Here are some references as to why we would have documents
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Am3.7">Amos 3:7</a> &ldquo;For the Lord God does nothing without revealing His secret to His servants the prophets.&rdquo;

						<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ge6.13">Gen 6:13</a> God tells Noah his plan and reasoning...

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.1Ki22.19-23">1 Kings 22:19-23</a> Micaiah tells Ahab that he saw the Lord sitting on His throne and all the host of heaven standing by Him and He tells the host his plan and asks for volunteers...
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.2Ki22.13-20">2 Kings 22:13-20</a> King Josiah and Hilkiah the priest, etc. to inquire to the Lord, seeing as how they just recovered the books of the Law and realized that their fathers and themselves had not been acting according to the law, and perhaps the Lord wanted them to do specific things now (the Lord rewards his humility and proper expectation)
					</p>

				<li>

						<a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Ps25.14">Psalm 25:14</a> &ldquo;The friendship of the Lord is for those who fear Him, and He makes known to them His covenant.&rdquo;

				<li>
					<p style="margin:0pt;">
						Come to think of it, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Re6-20">Revelation 6-20</a> is detailing things that will take place… And scripture in general, is a document that God shares with us to that we can know His past, His present and His future.

						returning to Isaiah and this reference again, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Is29.11-12">Is 29:11-12</a>, The vision is sealed because it is not understood, it is not that people cannot literally look into it… it would seem from <a href="https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleESV.Re5.3">Rev 5:3</a> that people and angels tried and could not understand.
